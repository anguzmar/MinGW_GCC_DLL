# What is This Project?
This is a small project I made in order to learn the following things:
  * How to make and compile a DLL using MinGW GCC.
  * How to use the Windows Crypto API (CNG).
  * Makefiles. I knew what they were but I never made one myself.
  * Windows development.รง
  * Tiny bit of C++, which I had never touched before.

Note that I am pretty much clueless about good practices.

# Usage
1. Clone this repository and navigate into its folder.
2. Compile the code: `make`.
3. Run the executable: `.\test_dll.exe`.

If everything worked correctly, you should obtain a fairly large random number.
